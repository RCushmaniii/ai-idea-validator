# Detail page
problem: "Founders waste years building ideas that are structurally replaceable—not because they're bad, but because they lack defensibility. Traditional validation focuses on execution, ignoring whether the idea can survive competition and platform changes."
solution: "An AI-powered assessment tool that cuts through founder optimism with 23 targeted questions, then uses GPT to generate brutally honest verdicts (KILL/FLIP/BUILD/BET) while detecting contradictions between self-assessments and written responses."

key_features:
  - "AI-driven verdict generation that analyzes qualitative responses, not just scores"
  - "Contradiction detection comparing founder self-assessment vs written answers"
  - "Score adjustment showing gap between perceived and AI-evaluated risk"
  - "Bilingual support (English/Spanish) with full i18n"
  - "JSON import/export for AI-assisted workflow integration"
  - "Offline fallback with heuristic analysis when API unavailable"
